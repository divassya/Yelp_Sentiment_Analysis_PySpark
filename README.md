## Assiya Karatay, Euiyoung Lee 

In this fast growing digital world, identifying and understanding customers’ emotions are essential in order to know how to engage with them directly. Sentiment analysis (aka. Opinion analysis) is a popular text classification tool that identifies customers’ underlying sentiment behind the texts in order to understand their opinion about companies products and services. 
For this project, we will be using Yelp’s dataset, which we retrieved from Kaggle. It’s a subset of Yelp’s businesses, reviews, and user data. Using this big customer’s review data, we will be conducting customer sentiment analysis using TFIDF and various Machine Learning models to detect customer’s positive or negative sentiment within their reviews.
